# Coding-Challenge-4

This project is based on a program that simulates an EV car using JavaScript. The objective of the assignment is to extend the program from a simple vehicle to an electric car. The main car functions are acceleration and braking, along with Speed ​​changes. The electric vehicle has the previous two incorporated and a new category that references the Battery charge. This new load category includes Chargebattery, which represents the recharge of the battery. Through an increase in speed by a margin it looks like the load of the battery decreases. This program helps to understand the EV car by testing different speeds.
